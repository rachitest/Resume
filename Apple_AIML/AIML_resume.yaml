    Relevant Experience:
      - company: The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston,
          School of Public Health
        position: Biostatistics and Data Science - Graduate Research Assistant
          (Doctoral)
        location: Houston, TX
        start_date: 2022-09
        end_date: 2024-10
        highlights:
          - Established DevOps practices, architected repository structures, 
            and implemented CI/CD pipelines. Designed and implemented ETL pipelines
            for datasets of various sizes, achieving a **24x speed increase over 
            prior solution leading to faster model iteration and deliverable
            generation.** 
          - Applied statistical models and machine learning techniques for data 
            analysis on vaccine non-response and Covid-19 pediatric comorbidities. 
            **Contributed to the publishing of three peer-reviewed articles, with 
            two more under review.**
          - Developed a weekly report generation pipeline with CI/CD, ensuring 
            seamless integration of new data. Planned and enacted a comprehensive 
            test suite, **increasing team lead confidence and reducing 
            publishing turnaround times.**
      - company: Genentech
        position: Research and Early Development, Development Sciences &
          Informatics - Informatics Intern
        location: San Francisco, CA
        start_date: 2021-05
        end_date: 2022-01
        highlights:
          - Contributed to the development of frameworks for an in-house data 
            annotation tool, utilizing advanced deep learning NLP models and
            custom processing pipelines. Created a efficient document 
            tokenization framework **allowing for fast and high-quality data 
            annotation for NLP model building** and downstream informatics systems.
          - Engineered a neural network using deep transfer learning, 
            to predict adverse drug events. Focusing on Drug-Induced Liver
            Injury created a **low parameter model that matched the prediction 
            accuracy of the SOTA model.**
          - Created a Knowledge Graph with Neo4j and a Graph Neural Network 
            using NetworkX and PyTorch to generate gene expression signature-likes 
            for drugs. Began the creation of a knowledge repository — an 
            accessible data source which **reduced the need to manually sift through 
            dense primary sources.**
      - company: Bristol Myers Squibb
        position: Data Engineering Intern
        location: San Francisco, CA
        start_date: 2020-06
        end_date: 2020-08
        highlights:
        - Developed a multifeatured patent recommendation web application. The 
          application implemented a mix of classical NLP algorithms (TF-IDF, BM 25) 
          and deep learning algorithms (BERT). **Improved bench scientists' 
          productivity by streamlining patent search and analysis workflow.**
        - Engineered and maintained performant ETL pipelines with Python and 
          Apache Airflow. Undertook extensive data cleaning and data wrangling
          on datasets of varying sizes (small, medium, and large) **ensuring data
          quality and readiness for analysis at a high velocity.**
        - Designed and maintained robust relational and graph databases in 
          PostgreSQL and Neo4j, **optimizing data storage and retrieval to 
          support various internal projects and analyses.**
