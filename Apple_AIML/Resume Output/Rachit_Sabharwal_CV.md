# Relevant Experience

## The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, School of Public Health, Biostatistics and Data Science - Graduate Research Assistant (Doctoral)

- Sept 2022 - Oct 2024
- Houston, TX
- Established DevOps practices, architected repository structures, and implemented CI/CD pipelines. Designed and implemented ETL pipelines for datasets of various sizes, achieving a **24x speed increase over prior solution leading to faster model iteration and deliverable generation.**
- Applied statistical models and machine learning techniques for data analysis on vaccine non-response and Covid-19 pediatric comorbidities. **Contributed to the publishing of three peer-reviewed articles, with two more under review.**
- Developed a weekly report generation pipeline with CI/CD, ensuring seamless integration of new data. Planned and enacted a comprehensive test suite, **increasing team lead confidence and reducing publishing turnaround times.**

## Genentech, Research and Early Development, Development Sciences & Informatics - Informatics Intern

- May 2021 - Jan 2022
- San Francisco, CA
- Contributed to the development of frameworks for an in-house data annotation tool, utilizing advanced deep learning NLP models and custom processing pipelines. Created a efficient document tokenization framework **allowing for fast and high-quality data annotation for NLP model building** and downstream informatics systems.
- Engineered a neural network using deep transfer learning, to predict adverse drug events. Focusing on Drug-Induced Liver Injury created a **low parameter model that matched the prediction accuracy of the SOTA model.**
- Created a Knowledge Graph with Neo4j and a Graph Neural Network using NetworkX and PyTorch to generate gene expression signature-likes for drugs. Began the creation of a knowledge repository — an accessible data source which **reduced the need to manually sift through dense primary sources.**

## Procter & Gamble, Consumer & Market Knowledge - Advanced Analytics Co-Op

- Jan 2021 - May 2021
- Cincinnati, OH
- Developed models to uncover consumer behaviors, market trends, and retailer patterns using clickstream data, **causing increased corporate effort on DTC online retail.**
- Created, maintained, and optimized big data ETL pipelines to ensure seamless data integration and processing leading to a **3x increase in analyst operational efficiency**.
- Implemented advanced DevOps practices by integrating unit-testing, containerization, and agile methodologies to improve team efficiency and code quality. **Increased code coverage from 0% to 70%**.

## Bristol Myers Squibb, Data Engineering Intern

- June 2020 - Aug 2020
- San Francisco, CA
- Developed a multifeatured patent recommendation web application. The application implemented a mix of classical NLP algorithms (TF-IDF, BM 25) and deep learning algorithms (BERT). **Improved bench scientists' productivity by streamlining patent search and analysis workflow.**
- Engineered and maintained performant ETL pipelines with Python and Apache Airflow. Undertook extensive data cleaning and data wrangling on datasets of varying sizes (small, medium, and large) **ensuring data quality and readiness for analysis at a high velocity.**
- Designed and maintained robust relational and graph databases in PostgreSQL and Neo4j, **optimizing data storage and retrieval to support various internal projects and analyses.**
